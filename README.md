Step by step  going through this project 
This is my  first project so I try to do what I know and learn step by step.
the  goal is to predict the  survived peaple on the test_data.

## 1. Data  Expolration:
The goal is to predict the survived column so I  like  to see the changes and relation betwean Survived column and other ones.
there are to difrent types ofcolumns: numerical  andcathegorical 
first of all I like to seprat  them  and  start to explore and see the relation  between  them
